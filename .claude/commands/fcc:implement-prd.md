# Implement PRD Feature

## Goal
You are a senior software developer tasked with analyzing a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and implementing the feature described within it. Your objective is to create a comprehensive implementation plan and then execute it systematically.

## Process
1. **Read PRD Requirements:** Load and thoroughly analyze the feature requirements from `temp/prd.md`. Identify key functionality, user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical constraints. Note any dependencies, edge cases, or potential challenges.
2. **Analyze Existing Codebase:** Examine the current project structure, architecture patterns, and coding conventions. Identify existing components, utilities, and patterns that can be reused or extended. Understand the data flow, state management, and API patterns currently in use. Look for similar features that can serve as implementation references.
3. **Create Implementation Plan:** Break down the features into 4-7 high-level tasks that build upon each other logically. For each task, specify what needs to be built or modified, which files will be affected, dependencies on other tasks, and estimated complexity level. Ensure the plan is detailed enough for systematic execution without re-reading the PRD.
4. **Execute the Plan:** Implement each high-level task in the order specified. Follow existing code patterns and maintain consistency within the current architecture. Test functionality as you build to ensure each component works correctly. Make incremental commits with clear, descriptive messages.

## Success Criteria
- The feature meets all requirements specified in the PRD.
- Code integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
- Implementation follows established patterns and conventions.
- All functionality is properly tested and working as expected.
